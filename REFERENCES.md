I just wanted to point out some respectable people in the React community that would be useful to learn from. These are not _all_ such people -- just the ones I'm aware of.

## Some Noteworthy People in the React Community

These people are well-known in the React community and have contributed to it significantly. They often help people understand React and good React principles. If they have an article, it's worth considering. If you have a question, it's worth seeing if they've answered it. Of course, it's always good to check the date of your resource and to think for yourself as well.
