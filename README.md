# Isaiah's Legacy

Hello and welcome to a random guy's attempt to document some new findings that he wasn't able to share earlier. I've decide to write everything in my own repository so that I can make improvements if I run out of time.

There are a broad range of things I want to cover, but here are a few big ones...

- [x] Markdown (`.md`) files (what you're reading right now) and documentation
- [ ] Configuring frontend frameworks (React, Vue) on your own or with help (CRA, Vue CLI)
- [ ] Using TypeScript with frontend frameworks
- [ ] Potentially useful folder structures
- [ ] Useful tools/packages for working with mock data
- [ ] Provide references to useful/respectable people int he React community

**_DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT_**

Let's get started...
