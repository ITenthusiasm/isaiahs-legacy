## Configuration

CRA handles all of the important configurations for you, and it leaves a couple ways to modify the configurations. Please note that instead of using regular configuration files, CRA requires you to edit `package.json` to adjust the settings. Some settings are hidden inside the installed package itself, with the intent that you'll never modify them.

For more information on how to customize the configurations, see [Create React App's official documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started). In this project, the ESLint config and Jest config are modified (through `package.json`).

One additional tool is used beyond what CRA provides: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). It's an excellent tool for formatting JS, TS, HTML, and more.
